				A ferocious beast rests inside a box, growing increasingly restless. Soon
				he will get agitated enough to leap out with his fangs drawn. Soothe the beast
				by hovering your mouse over its box, and stroke it by rolling your scroll
				wheel. When you are ready to unleash his fury on the vermin scuttling below,
				click on the box to awake him from his slumber.
